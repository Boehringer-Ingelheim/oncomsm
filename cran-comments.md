* Installed package size: The package uses rstantools to pre-compiled the 'stan'
model used for inference this leads to a large size of the installed lib folder.
* 'rstantools' requires GNU make as system dependency.
* 'abort', 'exit', 'printf' are found in the shared library.
All of these warnings come from code generated by 'rstantools'.
* There is no reference I would like to cite in the DESCRIPTION file.
'rstan' is referenced from the package description.
