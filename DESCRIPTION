Description: This package implements methods to fit a parametric Bayesian 
    multi-state model to tumor response data and to use the model to predict
    probability of success on the study level.
    The use of a multi-state model allows the dynamic computation of 
    probability of success during an ongoing study for a wide
    range of success criteria.
    The inference is implemented using stan.
