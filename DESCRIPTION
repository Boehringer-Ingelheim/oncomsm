Description: Implements methods to fit a parametric Bayesian multi-state model
    to tumor response data.
    The model can be used to sample from the predictive distribution to impute
    missing data and calculate probability of success for custom decision
    criteria in early clinical trials during an ongoing trial.
    The inference is implemented using stan.
