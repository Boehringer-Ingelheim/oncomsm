\arguments{
\item{group_id}{a character vector with the group ids, these are used to
check compatibility of data later}

\item{logodds_mean}{a vector with the means of the (truncated) normal priors
on the log-odds of the response probability}

\item{logodds_sd}{a vector with the standard deviations of the (truncated)
normal priors on the log-odds of the response probability}

\item{median_time_to_next_event_mean}{a matrix with the means of the
(truncated) normal priors on the median time to next event for each of the
Weibull transition probabilities, the (i,j)-th entry is the i-th group
median time to next event for transition j

\item{median_time_to_next_event_sd}{a matrix with the standard deviations of
the (truncated) normal priors on the median time to next event for each of
the Weibull transition probabilities, the (i,j)-th entry is the i-th group
median time to next event for transition j
(1=stable-response, 2=stable-progression, 3=response-progression)}

\item{visit_spacing}{vector of time differences between visits per group,
only relevant for sampling from the predictive distribution}

\item{recruitment_rate}{vector with per-group recruitment rates,
only relevant for sampling from the predictive distribution}

\item{max_time}{maximal overall runtime from first visit,
only relevant for sampling from the predictive distribution}

\item{logodds_min}{lower boundary on the log-odds per group}

\item{logodds_max}{upper boundary on the log-odds per group}

\item{shape_min}{matrix of lower boundaries of the uniform prior of the
Weibull distribution per group/transition}

\item{shape_max}{matrix of upper boundaries of the uniform prior of the
Weibull distribution per group/transition}

\item{x}{the model to plot}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to method implementations}

\item{data}{a data table with multi-state data}

\item{model}{a model of class "Model"}

\item{now}{the current time relative to the start of the trial (sot)}

\item{relative_to_sot}{Boolean, should the timeline be relative to the start
of trial or the start of treatment for each individual}

\item{tbl_visits}{visit data in long format}

\item{eof_indicator}{state name indicating (exactly observed) end of
follow up.}

\item{parameter_sample}{a stanfit object with samples from the respective model.}

\item{seed}{integer, fixed random seed; NULL for no fixed seed}

\item{dt_interval}{optional, fixed plotting limits in time since first visit}

\item{dt_n_grid}{optional, plotting resolution along time scale}

\item{dt_expand}{optional, expansion factor for the upper limit of the
automatically determine plotting interval}

\item{nsim}{number of samples to draw}

\item{t}{a vector of time-points at which the PFS rate should be computed}

\item{warmup}{integer, number of warmup samples for the rstan sampler before retaining samples; these are used to
tune the hyperparameters of the MCMC algorithm.}
