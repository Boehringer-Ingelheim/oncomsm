	abstract = {In clinical trials with time-to-event outcome as the primary endpoint, the end of study date is often based on the number of observed events, which drives the statistical power and the sample size calculation. It is of great value for study sponsors to have a good understanding of the recruitment process and the event milestones to manage the logistical tasks, which require a considerable amount of resources. The objective of the proposed statistical approach is to predict, as accurately as possible, the timing of an analysis planned once a target number of events is collected. The method takes into account the enrollment, the time to event, and the time to censor processes, using Weibull models in a Bayesian framework. We also consider a possible delay in the event reporting by the investigators, and covariates may also be included. Several metrics can be obtained, such as the probability of study completion at specific timepoints or the credible interval of the date of study completion. The approach was applied to oncology trials, with progression-free survival as primary outcome. A retrospective analysis shows the accuracy of the approach on these examples, as well as the benefit of updating the predictive probability of study completion as data are accumulating or new information becomes available. We also evaluated the performances of the proposed method in a comprehensive simulation study.},

	abstract = {flexsurv is an R package for fully-parametric modeling of survival data. Any parametric time-to-event distribution may be fitted if the user supplies a probability density or hazard function, and ideally also their cumulative versions. Standard survival distributions are built in, including the three and four-parameter generalized gamma and F distributions. Any parameter of any distribution can be modeled as a linear or log-linear function of covariates. The package also includes the spline model of Royston and Parmar (2002), in which both baseline survival and covariate effects can be arbitrarily flexible parametric functions of time. The main model-fitting function, flexsurvreg, uses the familiar syntax of survreg from the standard survival package (Therneau 2016). Censoring or left-truncation are specified in 'Surv' objects. The models are fitted by maximizing the full log-likelihood, and estimates and confidence intervals for any function of the model parameters can be printed or plotted. flexsurv also provides functions for fitting and predicting from fully-parametric multi-state models, and connects with the mstate package (de Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011). This article explains the methods and design principles of the package, giving several worked examples of its use.},

	abstract = {We compare two multi-state modelling frameworks that can be used to represent dates of events following hospital admission for people infected during an epidemic. The methods are applied to data from people admitted to hospital with {COVID}-19, to estimate the probability of admission to intensive care unit, the probability of death in hospital for patients before and after intensive care unit admission, the lengths of stay in hospital, and how all these vary with age and gender. One modelling framework is based on defining transition-specific hazard functions for competing risks. A less commonly used framework defines partially-latent subpopulations who will experience each subsequent event, and uses a mixture model to estimate the probability that an individual will experience each event, and the distribution of the time to the event given that it occurs. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two frameworks, in the context of the {COVID}-19 example. The issues include the interpretation of the model parameters, the computational efficiency of estimating the quantities of interest, implementation in software and assessing goodness of fit. In the example, we find that some groups appear to be at very low risk of some events, in particular intensive care unit admission, and these are best represented by using ‘cure-rate’ models to define transition-specific hazards. We provide general-purpose software to implement all the models we describe in the flexsurv R package, which allows arbitrarily flexible distributions to be used to represent the cause-specific hazards or times to events.},
